Purnauskis is Finland’s first cat café with a clowder of purring cats living in there. Cat café is the home of the cats and you are invited for a visit.

All of our cats have a different life story to tell. What’s in common is that they all love being pet.

We want to offer experiences to both cat lovers and other enjoyers. Decorative specialities and mysticism from cat world can also be found in the café.

We have also collected cat art around the world to Purnauskis and selected pieces of cat literature are available for reading with your cup of coffee.

One should not leave Purnauskis without any souvenirs. Cat themed jewelery, art and handicrafts are been sold in the cat café too.

We wish you a pleasant journey to our kingdom of cats!
